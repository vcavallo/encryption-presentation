# Hi!

These are the slides for a presentation to the Wondersauce weekly dev meeting on
July 20th, 2016.

This presentation was made with [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark), which
is an in-browser slideshow tool that allows you to write markdown (and some CSS)
to do all the things you'd ever need for a slide presentation. I think I'm in
love with it.

## To view this

Once you've cloned this repo, just open `home.html` in a browser window and
